## Why?

Well, I want to play a music from youtube. **mps-youtube** solve this problem, it has a good command line interface that let to play a music from Youtube. Yet, they are not offering a good interface for a non command line interface users. And, I'd like to share my 'player' to my family so they can play the music they desire.
